    Where :math:`P` and :math:`Q` are probability distributions where :math:`P` usually represents a distribution
    over data and :math:`Q` is often a prior or approximation of :math:`P`. It should be noted that the KL divergence
    is a non-symetrical metric i.e. :math:`D_{KL}(P||Q) \neq D_{KL}(Q||P)`.

    Args:
        p: data distribution with shape ``[N, d]``
        q: prior or approximate distribution with shape ``[N, d]``
        log_prob: bool indicating if input is log-probabilities or probabilities. If given as probabilities,

            - ``'mean'`` [default]: Averages score across samples
            - ``'sum'``: Sum score across samples
            - ``'none'`` or ``None``: Returns score per sample
