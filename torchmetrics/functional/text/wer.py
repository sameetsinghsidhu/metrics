    `Word error rate (WER) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_error_rate>`_ is a common metric of
    the performance of an automatic speech recognition system.
    This value indicates the percentage of words that were incorrectly predicted.
    The lower the value, the better the performance of the ASR system with a WER of 0 being a perfect score.

    Args:
        references: List of references for each speech input.
        predictions: List of transcriptions to score.
        concatenate_texts: Whether to concatenate all input texts or compute WER iteratively.

    Returns:
        (float): the word error rate, or if ``return_measures`` is True, we include the incorrect and total.

    Examples:
        >>> predictions = ["this is the prediction", "there is an other sample"]
        >>> references = ["this is the reference", "there is another one"]
        >>> wer(predictions=predictions, references=references)
