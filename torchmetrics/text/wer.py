class WER(Metric):
    r"""
    `Word error rate (WER) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_error_rate>`_ is a common metric of
    the performance of an automatic speech recognition system.
    This value indicates the percentage of words that were incorrectly predicted.
    The lower the value, the better the performance of the ASR system with a WER of 0 being a perfect score.
    Word error rate can then be computed as:

    .. math::
        WER = \frac{S + D + I}{N} = \frac{S + D + I}{S + D + C}

    where:

        - S is the number of substitutions,
        - D is the number of deletions,
        - I is the number of insertions,
        - C is the number of correct words,
        - N is the number of words in the reference (N=S+D+C).

    Compute WER score of transcribed segments against references.

    Args:
        concatenate_texts: Whether to concatenate all input texts or compute WER iteratively.
        compute_on_step:
            Forward only calls ``update()`` and return None if this is set to False. default: True
        dist_sync_on_step:
            Synchronize metric state across processes at each ``forward()``
            before returning the value at the step. default: False
        process_group:
            Specify the process group on which synchronization is called. default: None (which selects the entire world)
        dist_sync_fn:
            Callback that performs the allgather operation on the metric state. When ``None``, DDP
            will be used to perform the allgather

    Returns:
        (float): the word error rate

    Examples:
        >>> predictions = ["this is the prediction", "there is an other sample"]
        >>> references = ["this is the reference", "there is another one"]
        >>> metric = WER()
        >>> metric(predictions, references)
        0.5
